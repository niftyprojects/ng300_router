	  The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as “Shorewall”, is 
	  high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your 
	  firewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of configuration
	  files. Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the help of
	  the iptables, iptables-restore, ip and tc utilities, Shorewall 
	  configures Netfilter and the Linux networking subsystem to match your
	  requirements. Shorewall can be used on a dedicated firewall system, a
	  multi-function gateway/router/server or on a standalone GNU/Linux
	  system.
